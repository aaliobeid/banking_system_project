# Simple Banking System in Python

## Description

A console-based banking system that allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit, withdraw, and check balances. This project is designed to practice Python OOP, file handling, and basic account management logic.

## Features

* Create accounts with unique 8-digit account numbers.
* Secure login with password validation (requires at least one uppercase letter and one digit).
* Deposit funds into the account.
* Withdraw funds from the account with balance validation.
* Check account balance.

## Installation / Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd banking_system_project
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python banking_system.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to create an account or log in.

## Future Improvements

* Add a GUI for easier interaction.
* Integrate a database to replace file-based storage.
* Implement password encryption for enhanced security.
* Expand features to include transaction history and account management.
